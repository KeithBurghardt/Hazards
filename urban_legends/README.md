All urban legends collected in our analysis. We also include 2014 SNOPES data used as ground truth labels. 2014 data comes from Fessler et al., 2014.

The SNOPES data we collect from 2022 are of the form:
- NARRATIVE / Legend: the title of the legend
- URL: where to get this legend
- CLAIM: the broad claim from the legend
- LEGEND TEXT: example text (sometimes this is missing and we only have a claim)
- SNOPES RATING: whether SNOPES judges this legend is true or false or a mix
- Not used in 2014 (x): confirmation that these legends are distinct from those collected in 2014
- Type: Broad categories as defined by SNOPES, such as a fraud.

The Encyclopedia of Urban Legends data we collect are of the form:
- LEGEND TEXT: example of the legend
- Not used in 2014 (x): confirmation these data were not collected previously, although some ideas could overlap with SNOPES
- Chpt/page: the chapter and page number
- Reference/source: where the Encyclopedia says the legend was collected
