This Jupyter notebook is used to train our models and plot our data:
- Data collection: we collect annotated tweets and urban legends
- Model training: we train a several models and LLMs on these data to find the best performing model
- Model testing: we evaluate with ROC-AUC to account for differences in data balance
- Plotting: we use PyPlot to show the results (performance, and prevalence of hazards)
